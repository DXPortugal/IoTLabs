Please find the details of the Azure Pass codes and instructions on how to access given below.

1.	Please use the passcode assigned to your name given after registration. Each passcode has a specific value and is valid for a 30 days from the date of redeeming it.
2.	Each student will need a Work or School Account linked to Microsoft's cloud services (or sign up for a trial Office 365 Account [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sign-up-for-a-free-Office-365-for-business-trial-f340d012-ad0f-4b13-b539-8b160f3e9644?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US)).  Please redeem the Azure Pass codes with this Work or School Account.    Note, if you use a Microsoft Account (previously Windows LiveID) to retrieve these Azure pass codes, you may have to use or create a separate account to sign up for Power BI online (will be needed in this training).
4.	Follow the instructions on how to redeem your pass code and how to activate your subscription using the tutorial given under this link https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto.  You will check that it worked by visiting the accounts page at  https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions and seeing that "Azure Pass" is a subscription.
5.	Also, please make sure using this subscription you are able to login to the Azure Portal at https://portal.azure.com.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please **switch off** any Azure services that you used to run the hands-on-labs to make sure you save your remaining credit on the subscription for further use.

If I go to https://account.windowsazure.com and click on ACCOUNT CENTER, I see:
