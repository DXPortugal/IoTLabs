#Lab 3 - Using Node-RED with Microsoft Azure IoT
![Node-RED](/images/node-red.png "Node-RED")

In this lab, you begin by learning what is Node-RED, and the basics of using it with a Raspberry Pi 3 that's running Raspbian. One of the major goals is to connect your device to the cloud by using a Node-RED node that allows you to connect with Azure IoT Hub.

### Lab 3.1: Getting Started With Node-Red
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-1-getting-started-with-node-red) you will install *Node-RED* and *Node-Red node for Azure IoT Hub*. You will interact with the Node-RED editor and understand how to create and design flows.
Estimated time to complete: **15-minutes**. 

### Lab 3.2: Create your first flow
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-2-creating-your-first-flow.md) You will learn about the basics of Node-RED flows, and create your first flow. You will understand the mechanics of the Node-RED editor, learn to deploy and run the flows.

### Lab 3.3: Creating a more advanced Node-RED flow
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-3-creating-creating-a-more-advanced-node-red-flow.md) you will create a more advanced Node-RED flow. With this flow you'll get data from Internet (live UK total electricity consumption), process the values and understand if frequency is under 50 HZ or not.

### Lab 3.4: 
[In this lab](/content/lab-3-4-azure-iot-hub-examples.md) you will create a flow to explore several ways to send data to Azure IoT Hub, using the Azure IoT node. You will send basic data - from strings to JSON payloads. You will also check how to monitor data in Azure IoT Hub with Device Explorer dfesktop app.
